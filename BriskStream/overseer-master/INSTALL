****************************************************
Overseer suite v1.0b, Achille Peternier (C) USI 2011
****************************************************



*** INSTALL ***

Overseer requires the following development tools to be installed and configured on the targeted systems:

- libpfm (version 4.2.0, http://http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/)
- hwloc (version 1.2.0, http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/)
- freeipmi (version 0.8.12, http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/)

Please notice that Overseer has been successfully compiled with the version releases reported above. Newer versions of these external libraries might expose different APIs not fully compatible with our code. Overseer has been tested under Ubuntu 10.04+ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5+. Being based on libpfm4 and perf_events, a kernel version 2.6.31+ is required (2.6.35+ suggested for optimal performance).

Please also make sure that a Java environment (providing java, javac, and jar commands) is also correctly installed and available from the prompt. 
Make sure to have an OS global variable called JAVA_HOME pointing to the root of your JDK installation.
To build and install Overseer, type:

make
(sudo) make install
