# Compile and run VoipStream

## Dependencies
apt install libssl-dev

## Run

Example: ./bin/vs Configurations/seqs_default.json

Execute the VoipStream benchmark using a json configuration file "seqs_default.json" providing the parallelism degree of each operator and other configuration options. The generation rate option states how many tuples are generated by each Source's replica per second (0 means that the Sources work at full speed). The sampling option states the frequency at which the Sink's replicas must save statistics about received results.

## Dataset Generation
See the Storm/Flink versions of VoipStream for further instructions.
