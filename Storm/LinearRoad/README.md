# Compile and run LinearRoad

## Compile
mvn clean install

## Run
Example: java -cp target/LinearRoad-1.0.jar LinearRoad.LinearRoad Configurations/seqs.json

Execute the LinearRoad benchmark using a json configuration file "seqs.json" providing the parallelism degree of each operator and other configuration options. The generation rate option states how many tuples are generated by each Source's replica per second (0 means that the Sources work at full speed). The sampling option states the frequency at which the Sink's replicas must save statistics about received results.

To avoid Java 9 "An illegal reflective access operation has occurred" warning do the following:
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED'

## Dataset Generation
We use the tool available at [LinearGenerator]: https://github.com/walmartlabs/LinearGenerator
To compile the tool once downloaded:
	javac LinearGenerator/src/com/walmart/linearroad/generator/*
To run the generation:
	java -cp LinearGenerator/src/ com.walmart.linearroad.generator.LinearGen -o linear_road.txt -x 2 -m 1
